# Bishops application

This is an Apache Maven 3 project that I made as an Assignment.

# Rules
The rules are simple, at the start of the game, 4 black bishops are placed on the top, and 4 white bishops are placed on the bottom of a 4-by-5 chessboard. 

Your task is to change the poisitions of the bishops so the black ones will be on the bottom row, and the white ones on the top. 

You can only move the bishops in a diagonal line, and can't place a bishop on a tile which is guarded by a bishop from the opposite color.
